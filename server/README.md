# Backend
I need to choose backend service for that simple application.
Application only needs to deliver static content to front-end client.
I also want to be able to allow admin actions such as adding new content.
Therefore I need a simple solution.


Options:
- Conduit
- Pocketbase
- Parse server

### Choice
I decided to go with pocketbase as it seems to be very simple to setup.
Pocketbase also has large userbase and there's plenty of closed issues + tutorials to look fjr answers within.
