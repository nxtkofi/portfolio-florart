## Features

- [>] feature/3-art-slider-enhancements
  - ~~Make slider work on smaller devices~~
  - ~~Add finger-swiping feature~~
  - Current workaround is: slider gets smaller and smaller. What I want to achieve long-term would be the following:
    - The slider displays 3 images (just like now) on screens that are > 640px
    - The slider displays 1 image on screens that are ≤ 640px


  - [ ] feature/5.1-pagination
- [ ] feature/7-portfolio-page
- [ ] feature/13-product-page-api
  - Create api endpoint and prepare data from front-end to be sent
- [ ] feature/15-turnstile
  - Add Turnstile to <ContactForm/>
- [ ] feature/16-dark-mode
  - To specify darkmode colors you can use 'dark:' prefix to certain classes.
  - Dark mode will be turned on when you add 'dark' to your <html> tag.
  - [TailwindCSS DarkMode documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode)
- [ ] feature/17-subtle-animations
  - Add subtle animations to webpage to make it appear as more "smooth" e.g: slight image zooms on hover etc.
